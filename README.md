# Data and scripts for COVID-19

This GitHub repo contains data and scripts relevant to COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. For a full descriptions of our efforts, please see [https://www.aicures.mit.edu/](https://web.archive.org/web/20220812054522/https://www.aicures.mit.edu/).

Note that since relatively little data for SARS-CoV-2 is available, most of the data in this repo is for SARS-CoV (responsible for the 2002/3 [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome) outbreak) and other related coronaviruses. The hope is that models trained on this data will be able to retain their predictive ability on SARS-CoV-2.

Although the data contained in this repo can be used by any model, we have primarily been working with the message passing neural network model [chemprop](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop). The predictions from these models on the [Broad Repurposing Hub](https://www.broadinstitute.org/drug-repurposing-hub) are available in [predictions/](https://github.com/yangkevin2/coronavirus_data/tree/master/predictions).

## Experiment Commands

These commands are for running experiments using [chemprop](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop) and should be run from the main directory in the chemprop repo. You may need to modify some paths depending on your directory structure. The commands below assume you are using [AID1706_binarized_sars.csv](https://github.com/yangkevin2/coronavirus_data/blob/master/data/AID1706_binarized_sars.csv) but can be modified to work with any of the datasets.

### Generating RDKit features

To speed up experiments, you can pre-generate RDKit features using the script `save_features.py` in `chemprop/scripts`. You should run this command:

```
python save_features.py
    --data_path ../../coronavirus_data/data/AID1706_binarized_sars.csv \
    --save_path ../../coronavirus_data/features/AID1706_binarized_sars.npz \
    --features_generator rdkit_2d_normalized
```

By default this will run feature generation using parallel processing. On occasion the parallel processing gets stuck near the end of feature generation, so if this happens, just kill the process and restart with the `--sequential` flag. This will pick up where the parallel version stopped and will finish correctly.


### Training and testing

```
python train.py \
    --data_path ../coronavirus_data/data/AID1706_binarized_sars.csv \
    --dataset_type classification \
    --save_dir ../coronavirus_data/ckpt/AID1706_binarized_sars \
    --features_path ../coronavirus_data/features/AID1706_binarized_sars.npz \
    --no_features_scaling \
    --split_type scaffold_balanced \
    --quiet
```

The data splitting mechanism in [chemprop](https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop) is seeded so that this will reproduce the same train/dev/test split as in [splits.zip](https://github.com/yangkevin2/coronavirus_data/blob/master/splits.zip).

### Class balance

To run experiments with class balance, switch to the `class_weights` branch of chemprop (`git checkout class_weights`) and add the `--class_balance` flag. This will train with an equal number of positives and negatives in each batch.

### Multi-task training for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and SARS-CoV 3CLpro

Experiment combining data on the 3CLpro target for SARS-CoV-2 [​mpro_xchem.csv](https://github.com/yangkevin2/coronavirus_data/blob/master/data/mpro_xchem.csv) and SARS-CoV [AID1706_binarized_sars.csv](https://github.com/yangkevin2/coronavirus_data/blob/master/data/AID1706_binarized_sars.csv).

5-fold cross validation performance is 0.850 +/- 0.022.

```
python multitask.py \
    --data_path data/mpro_xchem.csv \
    --source_data_path data/AID1706_binarized_sars.csv \
    --dataset_type classification \
    --save_dir ckpt/
```
